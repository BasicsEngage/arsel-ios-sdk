# The Linux toolchain can build and test `Core/` (Foundation-only by design),

# iOS build — so `swift test` alone never executes the notification-delegate
# glue. Everything here targets an iOS Simulator for that reason.

# instead. (Borrowed from klaviyo-swift-sdk, which needs one command to work
